# C-Sharp-Guide
Repository for learning or checking useful C# code and techniques. As you can tell, it's quite the work in progress.
It's important to note that these examples are using [.NET Core, not .NET Framework](https://stackify.com/net-core-vs-net-framework/).

## Section 1 - Basics
### HelloWorld
Just the basics in this one. Simple variable types, string concatenation, and writing to console.

### Methods
Covers methods outside Main() and passing variable between them. If statements as well as for and while loops are mentioned. Briefly shows different exceptions for the try catch block.

### TicTacToe
Console game where 2 players compete to win. Uses 2D arrays to keep track of variables as well as some sloppy logic to check them.

## Section 2 - Classes
### Classes (contains Person.cs & Program.cs)
Example person class goes over methods, properties, constructors, and destructors

### Inheritance (contains Program.cs, Posts.cs, & Container.cs)
Creates children of children objects from inheritence and uses methods to store or retireve data for manipulation. **Program.cs** uses an ArrayList to store different objects, then uses their methods to interact with each other. **Posts.cs** covers inheritance and timer functions. **Container.cs** showcases how simple objects can start small and get more complicated as they evolve into their children classes.
